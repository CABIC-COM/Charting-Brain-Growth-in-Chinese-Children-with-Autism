# **CABIC Project Replication Code Repository**

## **Introduction**  
This GitHub repository contains the necessary code to replicate the **CABIC project**.  
**Note:** This repository **does not include any datasets**.  

The **Lifespan Brain Chart Consortium (LBCC)** has recently developed a comprehensive framework for mapping **nonlinear trajectories of human brain morphology** across the lifespan and has publicly shared their code.  
**Acknowledgment:** Our analysis is built upon their framework, and we appreciate LBCCâ€™s support.

## **Pipeline Overview & Script Descriptions**  

### **1. CABIC_data.R**  
- **1.1** Converts demographic data from `.csv` format into `.rds` format for easier computation and performs data aggregation.  
- **1.2** Specifies the output type, such as **GMV (Gray Matter Volume)** or **WMV (White Matter Volume)**.  
- **1.3** Uses the **Combat method** to harmonize multi-site training data.  
- **1.4** Generates model datasets for further analysis.  

### **2. CABIC_Main.R**  
- **2.1** Trains models using datasets and parameters defined in `CABIC_data.R`.  
- **2.2** Builds and saves the trained models.  

### **3. CABIC_Drawing.R**  
- **3.1** Uses the models built in `CABIC_Main.R` to plot **growth trajectory curves**.  
- **3.2** Visualizes and compares **developmental trajectories** between ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) and TDC (Typically Developing Children).  

### **4. CABIC_milestone.R**  
- **4.1** Tracks key milestones in the CABIC project workflow.  

### **5. CABIC_Subregions_Main.R**  
- **5.1** Similar to Step 2, developmental curves for each brain region were plotted using gray matter volume values for local brain regions  

### **6. CABIC_Normalised Centiles.R**  
- **6.1** Deviation from the standardized developmental curve compared to healthy controls was calculated for each input participant
